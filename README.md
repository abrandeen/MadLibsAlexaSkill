# MadLibsAlexaSkill

## Overview
This custom Alexa skill plays Mad Libs with users. To clarify, Mad Libs is a game traditionally played with a printed workbook that asks the user for certain parts of speech. The user takes the words they just thought of and plugs them into a story, often resulting in a silly, nonsensical narrative. To convert this traditional game into an Alexa skill, Alexa will ask the user for all the required words and then read the story back to the user. For example, the user would say “Alexa, play Mad Libs” and Alexa would respond with an opening message and “Name a plural noun.” Alexa would continue to ask the users for other types of words and finally read the complete story back to the user.
